Supported remoting commands. </br>
```powershell
Invoke-Command: Temporary ps session
Enter-PSSession: Persistent ps session
Exit-PSSession 
Disconnect-PSSession 
Receive-PSSession 
Connect-PSSession 
```

Variables or functions defined within commands are no longer available after you close the connection. </br>

To create a temporary connection, use the Invoke-Command cmdlet with the –ComputerName parameter to specify the remote computers. Then, use the –ScriptBlock parameter to specify the command. 

```powershell
Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-DC1 –ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog –log system}
```
To create a persistent connection with another computer, use the New-PSSession cmdlet. For example, the following command creates a session on a remote computer, and saves the session in the $s variable:

```powershell
$s = New-PSSession –ComputerName SEA-DC1
```
Use the Enter-PSSession cmdlet to connect to and start an interactive session. For example, after you open a new session on SEA-DC1, the following command starts an interactive session with the computer:

```powershell
Enter-PSSession $s
```

The interactive session remains open until you close it. This enables you to run as many commands as needed. To end the interactive session, enter the following command:

```powershell
Exit-PSSession 
```
